<h2>Volleyball</h2>
<h3>Players & Equipment</h3>
<p>Each team has 6 players on a court at any one time. Each player takes up a position in either the attacking zone (next to the net) or the defensive zone (at the back of the court). Three players are in each zone and rotate in a clockwise position after every point.
</p>
<h3>Scoring</h3>
<p>To score a point the ball must hit the ground within the outlined section in your opponents half. You can also score a point by your opponent failing to hit the outlined section within your half or your opponent hitting the ball into the net. A point can be scored off either teams serve.
</p>

<h3>Rules of Volleyball</h3>
<ul type="1">
  <li>Each team consist of 6 players and 6 substitutes. Players can be substituted at any time but if they are to return can only be swapped for the player that replaced them.
  </li>
  <li>Each team can hit the ball up to three times before the ball must be returned. The defensive team can then try and block or return the ball again hitting it a maximum of three times.
  </li>
  <li>Games are played up to 25 points and must be won by 2 clear points.</li>
  <li>Violations will be called for the following:
  <ul>
  <li>Stepping over the base line when serving the ball.</li>
  <li>Ball hits the net and fails to get over the net (If the ball hits the net and still goes over the net then this is perfectly legal).
  </li>
  <li>Players are not allowed to carry, palm or run with the ball.
  </li>
  <li>Players must not touch the net with any part of the body. If the net is said to have hit them rather than vice-versa, then this is ok.
  </li>
  <li>The ball cannot travel under the net.
  </li>
  <li>Players cannot reach over the net and hit the ball.
  </li>
