<h3>Players & Equipment</h3>

<h3>Rules of Football (Soccer)</h3>

<ul type="1">
  <li>Each team can have a minimum of 11 players (including 1 goalkeeper who is the only player allowed to handle the ball within the 18 yard box) and a minimum of 7 players are needed to constitute a match.
  </li>
  <li>The whole ball must cross the goal line for it to constitute as a goal.
  </li>
  <li>If a ball goes out of play off an opponent in either of the side lines then it is given as a throw in. If it goes out of play off an attacking player on the base line then it is a goal kick. If it comes off a defending player it is a corner kick.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>The Offside Rule in Football</h3>
<p>Offside can be called when an attacking player is in front of the last defender when the pass is played through to them. To be onside they must be placed behind the last defender when the ball is played to them. If the player is in front of that last defender then he is deemed to be offside and free kick to the defending team will be called. A player cannot be caught offside in their own half.
